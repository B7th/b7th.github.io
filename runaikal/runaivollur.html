<h1>Why</h1>
<p>Different moods calling for different modes? We've done this.</p>
<p>We want music that has more punch and microtonal instruments allow just that.</p>
<p>Problem is, not many exist or at least are readily usable by the public at large.</p>
<p>This here is an approach at the subject.</p>
<h1>Annotation</h1>
<p>Most of us know and love the 7 tones as well as the flats and sharps.</p>
<p>Those are intervals, and they vary in quality based on their ratios to a root.</p>
<p>Some intervals divide by multiples 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and even 13.</p>
