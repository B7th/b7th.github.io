## Thanks

This would not have been possible without the help of Phoenix Rising Metaphysical Emporium,
located in Langley, British Columbia.
Goldie and Jens, you both have helped me feel valid as both a witch and a crafts person,
and will forever be grateful for your open arms.

Similar can be said about Steve and Chris from 3dsmith, located in Vancouver, BC.
A good mix of craft, engineering and patience is necessary to turn a thought into a thing,
and through the past few years, many of these uncoverings would not have bathed under our sun
if it weren't from their help, and I sincerely appreciate the dedication to details they put out in the world.

Living as we do today, it matters to have each other's back
in the different spheres of our multifaceted existences,
and the career we undertake is no small part in that.
Having, as we say in French, bread on the board, (meaning work to be done),
I have a lot of respect and care for the team I work with.
You all have allowed me to know that I can have peace of mind
when I am out there enjoying the maps and here when we serve together.
I wish you clear paths ahead whether we continue
under the same or different roofs.

And I must thank you also, o fine visitor, for your curiosity,
which I hope will lead you to become a better, happier person.

May you always find what were seeking, whether you knew what you were looking for or not.
