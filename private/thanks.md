## Thanks

This web book is a work in progress grimmoire containing creations, spells,
and all things magical that came upon me through years of insight, struggles, joys, and meaning.

This would not have been possible without the help of Phoenix Rising Metaphysical Emporium,
located in Langley, British Columbia.
Goldie and Jens, you both have helped me feel valid as both a witch and a crafts person,
and will forever be grateful for your open arms.

Living in the world we do today, it matters to have each other's back
in the different spheres of our multifaceted existences.
Having, as we say in French, bread on the board,
(meaning work to be done), I have a lot of respect and care for the team I work with.
You all have allowed me to know that I can have peace of mind
when I am out there enjoying the world. I wish you clear paths ahead whether we continue
under the same or different roofs.

And I must thank you also, o fine visitor, for your curiosity,
which I hope will lead you to become a better, happier person.

May you always find what were seeking, whether you knew what you were looking for or not.
