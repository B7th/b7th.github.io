## Purpose

This web book is a work in progress grimmoire containing creations, spells,
and many things magical that came upon me through years of insight, struggles, joys, and meaning.

I steadfastly believe imagination to be the peering into what I call the *Different World,*
this fuzzy state where all that could be resides,
a wellspring each of us has been showered with in one way or another
by its grand and ethereal potential.

It has been my duty, then, to do the necessary witchcraft, for me meaning the power to
bring those beings into tangible existence, and share it with you.
