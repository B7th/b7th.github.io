# Creatures of the Different World

I immortalized some of the creatures I keep seeing from the Different World

## Lotusnail

The name says it all.
It's a snail on which grows something that looks like a lotus flower.

## Eyol

## Shendraak

This one has never been fully seen.

Only recognized as the Hand of the Sea, it helps those stranded in murky waters.

the Being known as Shendraak is here depicted as a two-thumbed, bi-nailed hand extending out of a bowl.
