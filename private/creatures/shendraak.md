= Shendraak, the helping hand of the Sea

It came to me, nagging me from time to time in the past two years.

The Hand of the Sea, reaching out to save one from murky waters, asking for nothing in return.

On April 17, I had to do it.

It reaches out from inside a 9 sided bowl, with its dual thumbs and nails.

It reaches to pull you out of troubled waves, whither it is safer.

The trip through the ripples, however, can leave you dazed.
