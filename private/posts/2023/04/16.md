# Wood's soul

![Wood's soul](/src/Woodsoul.png)

A flower pot made as an effigy of the Wood's soul,
a deer head painted with scenes of the land and sea throughout a day.

I enjoy walks and bike rides in nature.

One day though, as I was crossing into the deeper woodlands of North Vancouver, a weird sorrow overtook me.

The more I "discussed" with the feeling, the more it became clear that I was conversing with a fallen deer.

I don't know much else about this, but I was pressed with the need to remind myself of that experience.

At first, I was trying to make a wearable mask, but ended up downsizing to make it a flower pot.
This felt in a way much more respectful for the animal.

Now, weirdly, as I write this down, I have a feeling of deja vu. Huh. As if I wrote this before. Weird.

May you roam free, graceful wild one.
