# Lotusnail

![Lotusnail](/src/Lotusnail1.png) A snail shell on which grows a lotus.

This creation was made first as a gift to a friend,
and I feel that it is worth sharing to the greater world too.

This was in a way a being that represented what they wanted to do, bloom over time.

![Lotusnail](/src/Lotusnail2.png) I know that very entity exists somewhere, whatever existing mean.

Its dual fractal patterns represent both work and aesthetics,
both ephemerality and durability.
