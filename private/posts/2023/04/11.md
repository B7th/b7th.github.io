# Eyol

This odd little bird ball whistle watches as one moves and plays it around.

After a late night mushroom stew,
I had one of those wild dreams that I quite enjoy
and found myself in the same realm that I used to visit as a kid.

That realm is odd.
It maps out fairly consistently around my childhood house,
but has a somewhat hyperbolic space to it,
with an increasing quantity of thematic places the further I go from the centre.
It's honestly weird, especially that it remained constant over the years.

The Owl of olden days, which when a kid would bring me to the animal town, also stopped by.

Though its appearance this time seemed unreal. I felt like it was comfortable revealing its true shape, which was spherical and kaleidoscopal in nature, with way more eyes than I had ever felt at ease looking at me.

I had seen images of angels with their multiple eyes but that was the first time it happened to me.

I could feel its hunger (owls are carnivorous after all), but also its wisdom.
And it was clear that I had to allow it to live in this world.

After a bit of tinkering, it was finally freed as a handheld blow whistle.
