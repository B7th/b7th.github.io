# Quaster and its Orbs

The Quaster is what I feel the evolution of the Triskar.
While the Triskar's focus is on empowering oneself with time,
The Quaster's aim is to have *stewardship* over *matter*.

There is less of them in circulation than the Triskar,
but a few of its orbs exist free spirited.

This holder looks like two branches twisted together.
Having multiple names (Quaster, Twinhorn, Dikryos, and a few others)
its main purpose is to give its bearer control over the four forces that shape the Different World,
known as *Gleam*, *Stone*, *Yarn* and *Seeds*.

![Yarn](/src/Orb-Yarn.png)
**Yarn** refers to the first of four "forces" channelled in the Quaster.
It specifically helps create or maintain bonds, and in a way represent safety,
life lines, as well as in any way where something or someone is fastened to another.
5 Strings, two pairs in parallel and one alone all on different right axes,
are interwoven at 16 different meeting points.

![Stone](/src/Orb-Stone.png)
**Stone** refers to the force of gravity, helping to push, propulse, fight, move mountains,
the general idea of having stewardship over heavy matter.
Its presentation is meant to represent two masses having mirroring effect on each other,
hence the swirl clockwise meeting the swirl anti-clockwise.

![Seeds](/src/Orb-Seeds.png)
**Seeds** refers to the quantic force of emergence and fluidity.
Sand shifting around revealing the hidden,
waters slowly reshaping its own course beyond its myriad of drops,
money accrued and its potentials.
Its representation is 22 dots arranged with one centred around a small pentagon,
a big pentagon, a decagon, and a seemingly lost dot at its opposite end.

![Gleam](/src/Orb-Gleam.png)
**Gleam** refers to the near instantaneous, reactive force of light.
While mainly focused on emitted visuals, it also takes on the realm of sound,
specifically wind instruments. I find it helps me see what is usually out of reach.
It is represented by 7 waves vibrating from 3 to 9 times across the the sphere,
meeting at seemingly chaotic points.

As a reference, personally, the orb I connect most with is the Marsh Gleam,
as I find it fits with my base personality most.
