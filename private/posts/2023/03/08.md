# Triskar and its Orbs

The Triskar is pretty much what sparked everything else that you see here.

There is a few versions that exist for the different realms of the Different World,
though all of them have the main purpose to allow its bearer to *control* their *time* cycles.

This holder is made like a 3d version of the Triquetra,
showing that each of the three cycles are intertwined.

The **Sun** orb carries the Turtle Sun,
each head pointing at a general weather
(Clear, Cloudy, Thunders, Rain, and Snow)
and under the Night sky is represented
by what looks like a DNA strand,
and a constellation of two sets of two stars represent
the Inner and Outer grandiose.
This is where it all began, the Turtle Sun,
the mythical image of a five headed turtle swimming
in the sky sea out of which the fates of our day down poured.
That came to me on a cloudy day by the docks of old Stockholm

The **Moon** orb carries the swirling faces of the moon,
one showing the uncanny smile (friend of friends, foe of foes) of its shaded side,
and the other is an abstraction of the moon's craters
to show the 13 lunar months in a year,
in a spiral motion as a soft reminder of the Triskelion,
as well as apparently chaotic "irrigation marks"
that join at different angles.

![Wheel](/src/Orb-Wheel.png)
The **Wheel** orb carries 8 eyes or 8 plants depending on how you look at it,
each of which having the presence or absence of three separate elements,
a vertical line, a horizontal line, and a point.
Some could interpret these as three different genders and their associated "seasons"
but the idea is a reminder of the agricultural wheel.
