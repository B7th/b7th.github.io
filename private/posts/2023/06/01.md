# A Breach

I finally made a breakthrough, and feel proud for it.

I can feel in my bones that I have released what must.

In simple, I've had a lot of different things that happened, more good than bad,
that kind of "proved" to me that the path I was taking was the right one.

It feels a bit as if the fog-veil was lifted over my eyes.

I've removed a lot of things that cluttered my space,
and gave a hug to that which I was saying my farewells.

Sometimes a clean up declutters the physical and mental worlds.

And I can finally feel my fingers work with the finesse that I had dearly missed.
