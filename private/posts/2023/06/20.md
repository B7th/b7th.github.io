# The Uncertain

I've dealt with the uncertain at multiple occasions.

As the sun stands still for us in this half year mark,
I wish for all the freedom to do, play, love, be and become as they please.

It is easy to succumb to the morose. It is easy to lash at clouds.
I suggest *journaling*, a bit as I here do, albeit more raw.

To ink hard truths, harsh thoughts, and sorrows, and vanities, all as they come,
has dealt me a confidence that only a kind self-derision can deal.

In this exception, this ephemeral forever that is to biological exist, I see the same in all things,
and it pains me to no end that a neighbour, be they close or far, has less chance than I've had,
to be freed of chains, be they selfmade or elsebrought.

I commit to, through my daily work, deeds and craft,
bring peace in one way or another to at least one person per day,
as well as show gratitude to whoever would do the same to me.

Isn't it witchcraft to break soulshackles?

Isn't it magical to read back at who we once were?
